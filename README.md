# Angular + graphql template

It will look like this:
![preview.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pixelcomet/angular-graphql-template/master/preview.png)

## Prerequisites
- have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (tested on v12)
- have [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) up and running
- have nodemon installed globally `npm i -g nodemon`
- have the angular cli installed globally `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Starting the API
- navigate to `api/` in your terminal of choice
- install dependencies by running `npm i` (takes a while)
- run the api (restarts on code changes): `npm start`

(for the request types, see `api/insomnia/`)

## Starting the web interface
- install the cli: `npm i -g @angular/cli`
- navigate to `web/` in your terminal of choice
- install dependencies by running `npm i` (takes a while)
- compile and serve: `ng serve` (may take a long time at first start)


## Understanding this project
**API:**  
Start in `server.js` and find the referenced files, the comments will guide you. Example API calls can be seen in `api/insomnia/`, you can also install [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) and import `api/insomnia/insomnia.json` to try the requests out for yourself.

The `lists` and `to-dos` directories are what I call `resolver blocks`, they consist of
- `connectors.js` containing the structure of the objects this block will read/write
- `schema.graphql` to define the types, queries, mutations, etc. used by graphql
- `resolvers.js` contains the logic behind the schema
- `schema.js` combines schema and resolvers into an executable schema that can be accessed via the API


**Web interface:**  
Start in the `src/app/` directory, the non-default `.ts` files have comments, if have never seen an angular project, look [here](https://angular.io/start). You probably can't understand the code in this repo, if you have never built an angular app before.


## Production use
### API
- nodemon is not suitable for production use, install pm2 globally `npm i -g nodemon`
- run the server via `npm run prod`
- to see running services `pm2 list`
- to stop the service again `pm2 stop <id>` (replace `<id>` with the service id from the previous step)
- edit the cors rules in `server.js` to allow requests from the web interface
- you might also want to change the `DB_URL` constant in `globals.js` to use a remote mongodb instance

### Web interface
- edit te `uri` constant in `src/app/graphql.module.ts` to point to your api endpoint on your server
- run `ng build --prod` (may take a really long time)
- place the contents of the newly created `dist/website/` directory on your web root (`var/www/html/` on apache2)
- don't forget to configure the server in a way, that redirects all requests to the interface to `index.html` since this file includes the scripts that do all the routing
- there should be a `.htaccess` in `dist/`, it can be used to redirect on an apache2 server (for nginx google `nginx angular` ðŸ˜…)

## Frequent sources of errors
**I copied/renamed the `lists`/`to-dos` directory to make my own schema an it will not work.**  
- Edit the line with the `readFile()` call inside `schema.js` and change the path to the name of your new/renamed folder.
- Also you might have forgotten to include the new schema in `global-schema.js`, use the other imports as your template and add the new schema to the `schemas` array in `mergeSchemas()`
